<h2>
	The Maltese History
</h2>
<p> Maltese is the quintessential lap dog. It is extremely lovable and playful, and enjoys nothing more than to be pampered and praised by its owner. The breed is easily distinguished by its straight and long white coat, making it appear like it has just stepped out of a doggie hair salon. </p>

<p>
<br> <b> PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS </b></p>
The Maltese is a toy dog breed that has a compact and square body. It is entirely covered with silky, long, flat and white hair that, if allowed to grow to full length, hangs nearly to the ground. Its expression is both alert and gentle. As a vigorous dog, the Maltese moves with a smooth, lively, and flowing gait; it may even appear as the dog is actually floating on the ground when it is trotting.

<p> <b> PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT </b> </p>
Do not let the innocent appearance of this little dog fool you, it is feisty, bold, and not afraid to challenge larger dogs. Also, do not over-coddle these companion dogs, as it can actually do them more harm than good. Playful and self confident, it also makes a good watchdog, as it barks at strangers and other dogs, and is an intelligent dog. 

<p> <b> CARE </b> </p>
The exercise needs of the Maltese may be met with a romp in the courtyard, a short leash-led walk, or vigorous indoor games. Its coat, which may be clipped for easier maintenance, requires combing on alternate days and needs special grooming attention. The Maltese is generally considered an unsuitable outdoor dog but can fare well in either the city or the country. 

<br> <b> HEALTH </b> </p>
The Maltese, which has a lifespan of 12 to 14 years, may suffer from deafness, shaker syndrome, and dental problems. It is also prone to minor health issues like patellar luxation, hydrocephalus, open fontanel, hypoglycemia, distichiasis, entropion, hypothyroidism, and portacaval shunt. To identify some of these issues, a veterinarian may run knee, eye, and thyroid exams on this breed of dog.

<br> <b> HISTORY AND BACKGROUND </b> </p>
Reputed as one of the oldest dog breeds and the most ancient European toy breed, the Maltese has a curious history. Phoenician sailors visiting the island of Malta for trading around 1500 B.C. are credited for discovering the first Maltese dogs. From the 5th century onwards, dogs resembling the Maltese were found in Greek art. There is also evidence that the Greeks erected tombs to honor the Maltese.
